  <h1>This Week's Tech Challenge: Decode the Programmer's Riddle</h1>
  <p>Hello {{FirstName}}!</p>
  <p>It's that time again- We are back with a new challenge to stretch your tech muscles and ignite your problem-solving spark. This week, we're dialing up the difficulty with a puzzle that blends coding logic, pattern recognition, and a bit of creative thinking. Ready to dive in?</p>
  
  
  <div class="challenge-details">
    <h2>Challenge: The Binary Enigma.</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're trying to decode a secret message hidden within a series of binary numbers. However, these numbers are not random â€” they follow a special rule based on bitwise operations.    </p>
    <p>Here's the sequence you uncover:</p> 
    <p><strong>1010, 1111, 1100, 1001, 0110, ????</strong></p>
    <p>Your task is to find the next binary number in the sequence and explain the logic behind your answer.</p>
    <p><strong>Hint:</strong> The sequence is generated by applying a specific bitwise operation between consecutive numbers. Understanding how these operations work will help you crack the code.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>How to Participate:</h2>
  <p>Think you've cracked the code? Email your answer and the reasoning behind it.</p>
  
  <h2>Prizes and Recognition:</h2>
  <p><strong>Grand Solver:</strong> The first to submit the correct answer will receive a $20 Amazon gift card and be featured in our next newsletter.</p>
  <p><strong>Creative Thinkers:</strong> The next four insightful submissions will earn a spot in our "Hall of Fame" section, celebrating your cleverness and creativity.</p>
  
  <p>This puzzle is designed to challenge and inspire. We encourage you to think outside the box and look forward to seeing the innovative ways you approach this problem.</p>
  
  <p>Best of luck, and let the best minds prevail!</p>
  <p>Eagerly awaiting your solutions,</p>
